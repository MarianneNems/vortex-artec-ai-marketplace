# üîí VORTEX ARTEC Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Architecture

VORTEX ARTEC implements a multi-layered security strategy to protect our proprietary algorithms while maintaining investor transparency.

### üîê Repository Structure & Access Control

#### Public Repository (Current)
- **Purpose**: Investor materials, documentation, and public-facing code
- **Contains**: 
  - Business documentation (`INVESTOR_PITCH.md`)
  - System architecture diagrams
  - Public API interfaces
  - WordPress plugin structure (without proprietary algorithms)
  - CI/CD pipeline configurations

#### Private Repository (Proprietary)
- **Purpose**: Proprietary algorithms and sensitive code
- **Contains**:
  - VORTEX Secret Sauce (`class-vortex-secret-sauce.php`)
  - AI agent architectures (HURAII, CLOE, Business Strategist, TOLA)
  - Deep learning models and neural networks
  - Seed Art Generation algorithms
  - Zodiac analysis systems
  - Continuous learning engines
  - Private API endpoints

### üîë Access Controls

#### Branch Protection Rules
- **Main Branch**: Public, investor-accessible, requires 2 approvals
- **Develop Branch**: Protected, requires 1 approval  
- **Feature Branches**: Protected, requires PR review
- **Private Branches**: Admin-only access, encrypted

#### User Access Levels
1. **Public Users**: Documentation, architecture diagrams, public APIs
2. **Investors**: Access to pitch materials, traction metrics, roadmap
3. **Developers**: Public codebase, CI/CD, testing frameworks
4. **Core Team**: Full access to proprietary algorithms
5. **Admin/Founder**: Master access to all systems

### üîç Security Monitoring

#### Automated Security Scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Daily vulnerability checks
- **Code Analysis**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Secret Detection**: Prevent API keys/credentials in commits
- **License Compliance**: Ensure proprietary code protection

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **API Access Logs**: Monitor access to sensitive endpoints
- **Failed Authentication**: Track unauthorized access attempts
- **Code Access Patterns**: Detect unusual repository access
- **Data Exfiltration**: Monitor large file downloads

### üõ°Ô∏è Algorithm Protection

#### Response Filtering
- AI agents filtered to never reveal implementation details
- Automatic redaction of technical specifications
- Generic responses for algorithm-related queries
- Admin-only access to detailed system information

#### API Security
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- JWT authentication for proprietary access
- Encrypted data transmission
- Audit logging for all API calls

### üîí Data Protection

#### Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all proprietary data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **API Keys**: Encrypted storage with rotation
- **Database**: Encrypted connections and data

#### Environment Security
- **Production**: Isolated environment with VPC
- **Development**: Containerized with security scanning
- **Testing**: Sanitized data, no proprietary algorithms
- **Local**: Encrypted development environments

### üö® Incident Response

#### Security Incident Classifications
1. **Critical**: Proprietary algorithm exposure
2. **High**: Unauthorized access to private repositories
3. **Medium**: API abuse or rate limit breaches
4. **Low**: Failed authentication attempts

#### Response Protocol
1. **Immediate**: Lock down affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further exposure
4. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
5. **Review**: Post-incident analysis and improvements
